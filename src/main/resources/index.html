            <b>Agent-based Simulation of the Board Game Ludo</b>
</table>

<p>
    This simulation is an agent-based implementation of the english board game Ludo and will be played with 4 players.
    You can read the rules of the game under the following link: https://www.ymimports.com/pages/how-to-play-ludo.
<p>
    The simulation evaluates the performance of the player called "Observed" and writes the calculated results into a .csv file.
    The simulation has 4 strategies to change the behavior of the players.
    28 combinations of those strategies will be run a set number of times, to generate data for calculation.
<p>
    Strategies:
<ul>
    <li>
        First: Prioritises the game piece, that is closest to the goal.
    </li>
    <li>
